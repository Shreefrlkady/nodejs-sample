# Cloud Run and Cloud Build
API NODE.JS sample with Google Cloud Run and Google Cloud Build

## Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via HTTP requests and a Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most â€” building great applications.
