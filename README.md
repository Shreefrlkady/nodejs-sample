# Cloud Run and Cloud Build
API NODE.JS sample with Google Cloud Run and Google Cloud Build

## Cloud Run
Cloud Run is a fully managed compute platform that enables you to run stateless containers that are invocable via HTTP requests and a Cloud Run is serverless: it abstracts away all infrastructure management, so you can focus on what matters most — building great applications.

## Cloud Build
Cloud Build is a service that runs your builds on Google Cloud. You can import your source code from Cloud Source Repositories, GitHub, or Bitbucket, and perform a build to your specifications in a series of build steps. More information: https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/
